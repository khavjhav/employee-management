# employee-management
In the existing system organizations manage their employee payrolls manually. Payroll calculation is error prone as there is no system to keep track of leaves taken by certain employee. This process is time consuming as payroll should be calculated for each and every employee manually. Thus the existing system decreases the efficiency of the organization.Thisication is designed to replace the existing system so as to increase the efficiency of an organization. Employee details are saved to the database and each employee salary is calculated depending on his working days. Other emoluments and expenses are also calculated automatically and pay slips can be generated for all the employees at a time. Customized reports can be generated for analyzing the work pay patterns.
